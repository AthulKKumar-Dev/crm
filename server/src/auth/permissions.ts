/**
 * Fine-grained capability keys stored in `OrganizationMember.permissions`
 * (JSONB, shape: `{ grants: PermissionKey[], preset?: string }`).
 *
 * Design: warehouse-floor "roles" (Receiver, Picker, Packer, Dispatch,
 * Accounts) are NOT UserRole enum values — they are capability sets granted to
 * existing roles, surfaced in the team UI as named presets. A Picker is an
 * AGENT holding only `inventory.pick`. This avoids a Postgres enum migration,
 * keeps the RolesGuard→VendorAccessGuard ordering intact, and lets merchants
 * tweak per-user capabilities without new roles.
 *
 * Resolution rules (enforced by PermissionsGuard):
 *   - OWNER / ADMIN / MANAGER implicitly hold EVERY key.
 *   - AGENT and VIEWER hold exactly what their `grants` array contains.
 *   - VENDOR holds none — vendor floor access is a V2 question.
 *
 * `section.*` keys are a second family in the same grant list: which app
 * sections (nav tabs) an AGENT / VIEWER may open. They are enforced by
 * SectionAccessGuard via `@RequireSection(...)`, with one extra rule — a
 * member holding NO `section.*` key is unrestricted (see `resolveSections`).
