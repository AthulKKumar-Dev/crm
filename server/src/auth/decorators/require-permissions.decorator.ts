 * Require fine-grained permission keys on top of `@Roles(...)`.

 * `PermissionsGuard` is ALLOW-by-default: a route without this decorator is
 * untouched. With it, the request passes when the session role implicitly
 * holds everything (OWNER/ADMIN/MANAGER) or the membership's `grants` contain
 * ALL listed keys.
 *
 * Always pair with an explicit `@Roles(...)` — this decorator narrows within
 * the allowed roles, it does not replace role gating (RolesGuard is
 * allow-by-default, so a route with only `@RequirePermissions` would still let
 * an ungranted MANAGER through by design but also skip the roles audit).
