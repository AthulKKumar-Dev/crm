   *   1. Invoice numbers are statutory and gapless. Turning this on starts
   *      consuming serials automatically, and an org that is not ready for
   *      that should have to opt in.
   *   2. It only takes effect on LIVE webhooks — never on the bulk backfill,
   *      which on first connect would otherwise invoice up to
   *      SHOPIFY_INITIAL_ORDER_WINDOW_DAYS of historical orders in one burst,
   *      all dated today.
   *   3. `Organization.gstEnabled` and a registered GSTIN are still required;
   *      without them the attempt soft-fails and only logs.
   *
   * Payment, not placement, is the trigger: invoicing at placement means every
   * abandoned or cancelled order burns a serial and leaves a CANCELLED invoice
   * in the sequence that gets filed.
