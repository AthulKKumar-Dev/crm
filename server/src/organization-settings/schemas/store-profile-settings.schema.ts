 * The merchant's own business identity — the "From" half of a package slip,
 * and the contact block printed under it.
 *
 * This exists because there was nowhere else for it. `Organization` carries
 * `name`, `website` and `logo` and nothing more: no address, no phone, no
 * support email, and no UI that ever writes `logo`. The packing slip therefore
 * shipped with a free-text "Company name" box saved to the operator's own
 * localStorage, which every operator had to retype and which no invoice or
 * email could ever read.
 *
 * Stored as `OrganizationSettings.storeProfileSettings` (JSONB) and validated
 * here before any write, so adding a field later needs no migration.
 *
 * Kept FLAT, like its sibling domains: the service merges with a shallow
 * spread, so a nested object would be replaced wholesale and a partial PATCH
 * would silently drop sibling keys.
 *
 * The address keys are deliberately the app's CANONICAL set (address1,
 * address2, city, province, zip, country) — the same ones
 * `OrganizationGstin.address`, `Warehouse.address` and the client's
 * `readAddress()` use. That is what lets the slip fall back from this profile
 * to the dispatch warehouse to the default GSTIN without a translation layer.
