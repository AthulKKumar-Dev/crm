 * Canonical VIP-tier pill styling and labels.

 * Same shape as `order-status.ts`, for the same reason: these maps were inlined
 * in `routes/app/orders/customers.tsx` on raw palette utilities
 * (`bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-700`, `bg-gray-100 … dark:bg-gray-800`) with no
 * token behind them. One source now, so the list and the customer detail page
 * cannot drift the way the order-status copies did.
