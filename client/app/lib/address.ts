 * Canonical reader for the loosely-typed address JSON.

 * `Customer.addresses` / `defaultAddress` and the order address columns are all
 * `Json` — Shopify's payload passes through more or less verbatim, so keys are
 * snake_case there and camelCase on CRM-native records.
 *
 * Three other readers already exist (`readAddress` in routes/app/orders/$id.tsx,
 * `order-slip.tsx`, `vendor-order-detail.tsx`), each with its own key-alias
 * policy. This is the one meant to replace them; they are untouched for now, so
 * migrate them here rather than adding a fourth.
