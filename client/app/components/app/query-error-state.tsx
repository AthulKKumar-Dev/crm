 * Shown when a query FAILED, as opposed to succeeding with nothing in it.
 *
 * Those two were previously indistinguishable: a 500 or a dropped connection
 * left `data` undefined, the page coalesced that to `[]`, and the user was told
 * "No orders found — orders will appear here once synced from your channels".
 * A broken page and a brand-new store looked identical.
 *
 * Deliberately a thin wrapper over `EmptyState` rather than a new design: that
 * component already takes an `icon` and an `action`, and several routes already
 * pass a Button as the action. This exists only so the wording and the retry
 * affordance stay identical across call sites.
